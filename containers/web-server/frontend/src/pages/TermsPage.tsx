    <Typography variant="h1">Privacy Policy</Typography>

    <p>https://global.infrastructureresilience.org (“This site”) is operated by
      the University of Oxford. We are committed to protecting the privacy and
      security of your personal information ('personal data').</p>

    <p>This policy, together with our terms of use (see above) and together with
      any other documents referred to in it, describes how we collect and use your
      personal data during your use of our site, in accordance with the General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and associated data protection
      legislation. </p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Who is using your personal data?</Typography>

    <p>The University of Oxford1 is the “data controller" for the information
      that you provide to us when visiting this website. This means that we decide
      how to use it and are responsible for looking after it in accordance with
      the GDPR. </p>

    <p>Access to your personal data within the University will be provided to
      those staff who need to view it as part of their work in connection with the
      operation of this website.</p>

    <p>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices
      regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. We may update this
      policy at any time.</p>

    <p>By visiting our site you are accepting and consenting to the practices
      described in this policy.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Glossary</Typography>

    <p>Where we refer in this policy to your 'personal data', we mean any
      recorded information that is about you and from which you can be identified.
      It does not include data where your identity has been removed (anonymous
      data).</p>

    <p>Where we refer to the 'processing' of your personal data, we mean
      anything that we do with that information, including collection, use,
      storage, disclosure or retention. </p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Types of data we collect about you</Typography>

    <p>We may collect, store, and use the following categories of data when you
      use our site:</p>

    <Typography variant="h3">Data you give us.</Typography>

    <p>We do not collect or request any data directly from you.</p>

    <Typography variant="h3">Data we collect about you automatically.</Typography>

    <p>If you visit our site, we will automatically collect certain technical
      information, for example, the type of device (and its unique device
      identifier) you use to access our site, the Internet protocol (IP) address
      used to connect your device to the Internet, browser type and version,
      operating system and platform. </p>

    <p>We will automatically collect information about your visit to our site
      including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through
      and from the Website (including date and time), pages you viewed, response times,
      download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information
      (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from
      the page.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">When we collect your data</Typography>

    <p>When you visit our site we automatically collect a minimal amount of
      technical information about your visit.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">How we use your data</Typography>

    <p>We process your data for one or more of the following reasons: </p>

    <ul>

      <li>For purposes arising from your use of this website, for example, to
        ensure that we understand how our site is used and to improve our site and
        ensure it is secure. This processing occurs because it is necessary to
        meet our legitimate interests in operating this website. Information
        processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to IP address,
        URL, request headers and date and time of HTTP/S requests</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We will only use your data for the purposes for which we collected it,
      unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related
      reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need
      to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use
      it for that new purpose. </p>

    <p>Please note that we may process your data without your knowledge or
      consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or
      permitted by law.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Sharing your data with third parties</Typography>

    <p>We may share your data with third parties who provide services on our behalf,
      such as those who help us to operate the website, or with Google through Google
      Analytics. All our third-party service providers are required to take appropriate
      security measures to protect your data in line with our policies. We do not allow
      them to use your data for their own purposes. We permit them to process your data
      only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

    <p>We may also share your personal data with third parties if we are under a duty
      to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal
      obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our site terms of use or to protect
      the rights, property or safety of our site, our users, and others.</p>

    <p>Where your data is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum
      amount necessary.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Where we store or use your data</Typography>

    <p>We may store data collected by the website manually or electronically.
      The data is stored on our secure servers and/or in our premises within the
      UK.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
      completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
      data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to the website
      and any transmission is at your own risk. </p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Third party websites</Typography>

    <p>Our site contains links to and from various third party websites. If you
      follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have
      their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or
      liability for these policies.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Retaining your data</Typography>

    <p>We will only retain your data for as long as we need it to fulfil our
      purposes, including any relating to legal, accounting, or reporting
      requirements.</p>

    <Typography variant="h2">Your rights</Typography>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Request access to your data (commonly known as a "subject access
        request"). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check
        that we are lawfully processing it.</li>

      <li>Request correction of your data. This enables you to ask us to correct
        any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you.</li>

      <li>Request erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
        remove your data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
        process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
        data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see
        below).</li>

      <li>Object to processing of your data where we are relying on our
        legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
        processing on this ground.</li>

      <li>Request the restriction of processing of your data. This enables you
        to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want
        us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>

      <li>Request the transfer of your data to another party. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not
      be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a
      statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it
      would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop.
      However, where you have consented to the processing (for example, where you
      have asked us to contact you for marketing purposes) you can withdraw your
      consent at any time by emailing us at the contact email address given above.
      In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can. However, this
      will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your
      withdrawal of consent and you may no longer be able to use the site in the
      same way as you did before.</p>

    <p>If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or are
      dissatisfied with the way we have used your information, you should contact
      the University's Information Compliance Team at
      <a href="mailto:data.protection@admin.ox.ac.uk">data.protection@admin.ox.ac.uk</a>. The same email address may be used to
      contact the University's Data Protection Officer. We will seek to deal with
      your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the
      requirements of the GDPR. Please note that we may keep a record of your
      communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>

    <p>If you remain dissatisfied, you have the right to lodge a complaint with
      the Information Commissioner's Office at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/">https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</a>. </p>
