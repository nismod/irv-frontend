            This builds on previous research and development funded by UK AID
            through the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) as
            part of a project with the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) under the
            Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment&rsquo;s (CCRI) work on
            "Systemic Resilience" in collaboration with the Green Climate Fund,
            and also through the High-Volume Transport Applied Research project.

            Japanâ€”World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in Developing
            Countries, which is financed by the Government of Japan and managed
