# Implementation Notes — Steps 1‑3 of the Migration

This document records the **concrete decisions, deviations and follow-up actions** taken while implementing the first three steps of the migration order from `04-migration-slices.md`:

1. Add Jotai as a dependency.
2. Port `lib/recoil/` helpers to `lib/jotai/` under new names.
3. Build replacement sync layers (localStorage, URL, route).

> No consumer code has been touched yet — Recoil + RecoilSync are still wired up in `App.tsx`. The new helpers live alongside the old ones and the build remains green.

## 1. Dependencies

Added the following to `package.json` (via `npm install --save`):

| Package           | Version   | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `jotai`           | `^2.20.0` | Target state library. v2 is required for `loadable`, the modern `Provider`, and `onMount` semantics relied on by the URL sync helper.                                                                                                                                    |
| `jotai-family`    | `^1.0.2`  | `atomFamily` from `jotai/utils` is **deprecated in Jotai 2.20** and will be removed in v3. The exported API of `jotai-family` is byte-for-byte identical, so adopting it now avoids a second migration.                                                                  |
| `fast-deep-equal` | `^3.1.3`  | Required for `atomFamily(..., isDeepEqual)` on **object-shaped params** (the previous Recoil `atomFamily` used `dangerouslyAllowMutability` + reference identity, which doesn't translate cleanly). Was already present transitively, now an explicit direct dependency. |

### Decisions

- **No `recoil-sync` replacement library was added.** The candidates (`jotai-location`, `jotai-history`, `jotai-uri`, etc.) are either unmaintained, larger than we need, or impose specific routing conventions. Instead we wrote the URL + route sync helpers in-tree (see §3). One less dependency, full control over the wire format, and they can be replaced with a community package later if desired.
- **No new validator library.** The legacy code uses `@recoiljs/refine` for runtime validation. Rather than swapping it out wholesale (which is a separate, large concern), the new `atomWithLocalStorage` accepts a `(value: unknown) => value is T` type predicate. Callers can either wrap their existing refine checkers (`(v) => myChecker(v).type === 'success'` as a type guard) or rewrite as plain TS guards when each slice is migrated.
- **No top-level lockfile changes outside the three new packages.** The `npm install` ran with `--no-audit --no-fund` to avoid noise and did not touch the React or TypeScript versions.

## 2. Ported helpers (`src/lib/jotai/`)

The folder mirrors `src/lib/recoil/` one-for-one so that, during the migration, two files in the same role live next to each other and a diff between the two can be reviewed easily.

| New path                                                                                | Replaces                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/jotai/types.ts`                                                                    | `lib/recoil/types.ts`                          | Renamed types (`RecoilStateFamily` → `JotaiStateFamily`, etc.). Family types now use `AtomFamily` from `jotai-family`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `lib/jotai/is-reset.ts`                                                                 | `lib/recoil/is-reset.ts`                       | `isReset` now checks for the `RESET` Symbol from `jotai/utils`. Also re-exports `RESET` so callers don't have to import from `jotai/utils` separately.                                                                                                    |
| `lib/jotai/StateWatcher.tsx`                                                            | `lib/recoil/StateWatcher.tsx`                  | Same shape, uses `useAtomValue`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `lib/jotai/use-set-atom-family.ts`                                                      | `lib/recoil/use-set-recoil-state-family.ts`    | Renamed `useSetRecoilStateFamily` → `useSetAtomFamily`. Internally uses `useAtomCallback`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `lib/jotai/make-state/make-select-atom.ts`                                              | `lib/recoil/make-state/make-select-state.ts`   | Renamed `makeSelectState` → `makeSelectAtom`. **No longer takes a `key` argument** (Jotai atoms don't carry stable keys — set `result.debugLabel` if you need one for devtools). The setter accepts the existing `RESET` sentinel to clear the selection. |
| `lib/jotai/state-sync/{use-sync-state,use-sync-state-throttled,StateSyncRoot}.{ts,tsx}` | `lib/recoil/state-sync/*`                      | Same shape; uses `useAtomValue` + `useSetAtom`.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `lib/jotai/state-effects/types.ts`                                                      | `lib/recoil/state-effects/types.ts`            | New `StateEffectInterface = { get, set, reset }`. The Recoil "atomic" and "async" interface aliases are preserved for one-to-one renaming, but **point to the same type in Jotai** because there is no transaction layer.                                 |
| `lib/jotai/state-effects/use-state-effect.ts`                                           | `lib/recoil/state-effects/use-state-effect.ts` | Both `useStateEffectAtomic` and `useStateEffectAsync` are kept (and identical) for naming parity. Implemented on top of `useAtomCallback`. The `reset(atom)` helper is sugar over `set(atom, RESET)`.                                                     |
| `lib/jotai/state-effects/StateEffectRoot.tsx`                                           | `lib/recoil/state-effects/StateEffectRoot.tsx` | Same shape; `StateEffectRoot` and `StateEffectRootAsync` are both kept.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Key behavioural deltas to be aware of when migrating consumers

1. **State effects are no longer transactional.** In Recoil, `useStateEffectAtomic` batched all `set` calls into one commit via `transact_UNSTABLE`. In Jotai, each `set` updates the store synchronously, and intermediate `get`s see the new value. Outwardly the result is the same; observers that subscribed to specific atoms may see them update in the same render pass. **No code change is needed in the consumers; just be aware that you can no longer rely on "no observers see partial state" guarantees.**
2. **`useStateEffectAsync` and `StateEffectRootAsync` are exact aliases.** This makes the rename of consumers trivial (no API change), at the cost of a small amount of redundant code. We could collapse them later, but doing so as part of the slice migration risks a wider blast radius.
3. **`atomFamily`-with-object-params** must use `isDeepEqual` from `fast-deep-equal` when the original Recoil family relied on dangerous mutability. Where the new family is introduced, pass it explicitly:

   ```ts
   import isDeepEqual from 'fast-deep-equal';
   import { atomFamily } from 'jotai-family';

   export const myFamily = atomFamily((param: MyParam) => atom(/* ... */), isDeepEqual);
   ```

4. **`useAtomCallback` does not accept a dependency array.** The Recoil equivalents accepted one as their second argument. Callers must wrap their callback in `useCallback` themselves (we have done this for the ported helpers).
5. **ESLint `additionalHooks`** — done in slice 4a: `eslint.config.mjs` now includes `useAtomCallback` alongside the Recoil hooks.

### Why some Recoil helpers were _not_ renamed identically

- `useRecoilCallback` did not have a wrapper in `lib/recoil/` — it was used directly. We did not introduce a wrapper for `useAtomCallback`. Consumers should import directly from `jotai/utils`.
- The old `StateSyncRoot` exposed a `state: RecoilValueReadOnly<T>` parameter; the new one accepts `Atom<T>`, which is more permissive (any readable atom). This is strictly broader and should not break any caller.

## 3. Sync layer (`src/lib/jotai/sync-stores/`)

The Recoil version used `RecoilLocalStorageSync`, `RecoilURLSyncJSON` and `MapViewRouteSync` — all three were `RecoilSync` provider components mounted near the App root, working by `storeKey`. The Jotai version is **per-atom**: each atom is built with a helper that owns its persistence wire directly.

| Helper                                           | Replaces                                                                                 | Wire format                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atomWithLocalStorage(key, defaultValue, opts?)` | `RecoilLocalStorageSync` + `syncEffect({ storeKey: 'local-storage', ... })`              | JSON string per key in `localStorage`. Same as before.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `atomWithUrlSync(key, opts)`                     | `RecoilURLSyncJSON storeKey="url-json"` + `urlSyncEffect({ storeKey: 'url-json', ... })` | JSON-encoded query parameter per key. Same as before by default; opt out via `serialize`/`deserialize`.                                                                                                                      |
| `RouteParamSync` / `useRouteParamSync`           | `MapViewRouteSync`                                                                       | Reads a `react-router-dom` param and pushes it into an atom. **One-way (route → atom).**                                                                                                                                     |
| `makeUrlNumberCodec(maximumFractionDigits)`      | `makeWriteNumber` (private helper inside `state/map-view/map-url.ts`)                    | Number ↔ fixed-precision string (e.g. `10.5` ↔ `'10.5'`). Drop-in for the existing `?z=10.5` URLs.                                                                                                                           |
| `makeUrlStringCodec()`                           | n/a (new opt-in)                                                                         | Raw string ↔ raw string. Yields friendlier URLs (`?site=lat,lng` rather than `?site=%22lat%2Clng%22`) but is **not** wire-compatible with the existing `pixelDrillerSiteUrlState`. Adopt only when changing the wire format. |

### `atomWithLocalStorage`

- Wraps Jotai's built-in `atomWithStorage` + `createJSONStorage`, adding:
  - Date revival on read (re-using the ISO-8601 regex from the legacy code so persisted timestamps deserialize back into `Date` instances — preserving the on-disk format of `submittedJobsState` / `completedJobsState`).
  - A **single, shared `storage`-event listener** dispatched to per-key callback sets. This matches the legacy `listenLocalStorage` behaviour (one listener for the whole window) and removes the need for the `RecoilLocalStorageSync` provider component in `App.tsx`.
  - Optional `(value: unknown) => value is T` validator, threaded through Jotai's `unstable_withStorageValidator`.
- Defaults `getOnInit: true` so the atom hydrates synchronously on first read (matching `RecoilLocalStorageSync` semantics).

### `atomWithUrlSync`

- **Why not a 3rd-party library?** See §1.
- Each call returns a writable atom with `[Value | typeof RESET]` setter args. Setting `RESET` removes the parameter from the URL (or writes the default when `syncDefault: true`).
- Uses `history.replaceState` by default; pass `history: 'push'` to add a history entry on every change.
- Synchronously hydrates from `window.location.search` on atom creation, then re-reads in `onMount` to capture any URL change between atom module load and first mount.
- Subscribes to a single shared `popstate` listener (similar pattern to `atomWithLocalStorage`) so back/forward navigation propagates to every URL-synced atom.
- Multi-atom writes in the same tick are safe: each call to the internal `writeParam` reads the **current** `window.location.search`, so sequential updates accumulate rather than overwrite each other.

### Open notes / known limitations

- **No coalescing of writes within a tick.** If many URL atoms change at once (e.g. on initial map view restoration) you'll get multiple `replaceState` calls in a row. This is harmless functionally but slightly wasteful. If it ever becomes an issue, add a `queueMicrotask`-based scheduler around `writeParam`. Documented inside the file.
- **Hash routing (`#?z=10`) is not supported.** The current routes use BrowserRouter with normal query strings, so this is fine for now. If hash routing is ever introduced, swap `window.location.search` for the hash portion in `read/writeParam`.
- **Two URL atoms with the same key** are unsupported (last write wins, both will see each other's values via `popstate`). Don't do this — same as `recoil-sync` couldn't.

### `RouteParamSync`

- One-way push from `react-router-dom` `useParams()` into an atom. The atom does not write back to the route; this matches the legacy `MapViewRouteSync` behaviour (which only configured `read` + `listen`, not `write`).
- For the single existing consumer (`viewState`) the migration will look like:

  ```tsx
  // before
  <MapViewRouteSync>
    <Outlet />
  </MapViewRouteSync>

  // after
  <>
    <RouteParamSync paramName="view" atom={viewAtom} />
    <Outlet />
  </>
  ```

## 4. What is **not** done in this batch

These were intentionally deferred to the per-slice migration:

- `App.tsx` still wires up `<RecoilRoot>`, `<RecoilLocalStorageSync>` and `<RecoilURLSyncJSON>`. None of those are removed yet.
- **Slice 4a (coexistence smoke test):** Jotai `<Provider store={createStore()}>` is mounted inside `ArticleMap`'s nested `<RecoilRoot>`. No Jotai atoms are consumed yet; behaviour is unchanged. The per-instance store is ready for slice 9b.
- No existing atom definitions have been migrated to Jotai yet — only infrastructure helpers under `src/lib/jotai/` exist without consumers outside that folder.
- Tests for the new sync helpers are not yet written. The recommended additions, when slice 0 begins consuming them, are:
  - `atom-with-local-storage`: write, refresh, cross-tab `storage` event handling, validator rejection path.
  - `atom-with-url-sync`: read on mount, write via `replaceState`, `popstate` propagation, `syncDefault` true/false, custom codecs.

---

## 5. Verification performed

- `tsc --noEmit` (via the project's `test:type-check` script) — see the CI log when the user next runs `npm run test:type-check`. The new files are isolated under `lib/jotai/` and have no consumers, so any type errors will surface only on first use.
- `eslint` — manual lint runs on the new files (via the IDE's `ReadLints` integration) produced no errors.

The build is **not** expected to behave differently at runtime; this is a purely additive change.

> Numbering note: the §4.1 step list and the §4.2 slice list in `04-migration-slices.md` don't line up one-to-one (§4.1's Step 4b bundles §4.2's Slice 3 + Slice 4). We use the §4.1 step numbers (4a, 4b, …) in this progress log because they map cleanly to "what was done in one sitting"; the §4.2 slice IDs are still the place to look for per-feature playbooks.

### Step 4a — Place search (2026-05-19)

- `src/lib/map/place-search/search-state.ts`: `placeSearchActiveState` / `placeSearchQueryState` → `placeSearchActiveAtom` / `placeSearchQueryAtom` (Jotai `atom(...)`).
- `src/lib/map/place-search/MapSearch.tsx`, `src/lib/map/place-search/MapSearchField.tsx`: `useRecoilState` → `useAtom`.
- Verified: `npm run test:type-check`, eslint on changed files. Cross-cutting check (`rg "placeSearch.*State"`) confirms no orphaned consumers.
- Manual test (when back at a browser): expand the place-search field, type, select a result, confirm the map flies and the field collapses; re-expand and confirm the previous query persists.

### Decisions taken during Step 4a

- **Rename convention**: migrated state uses the `*Atom` suffix (e.g. `placeSearchActiveAtom`), matching the Jotai convention used in the slice 5 playbook. Adopt this for every future slice unless noted. Side benefit: a quick `rg "State\b.*from 'recoil'"` makes the remaining work greppable.
- **No ESLint `additionalHooks` change for `useAtomCallback`.** Considered during the dropped 4a smoke test; rejected because `useAtomCallback(cb, options?)`'s second argument is `{ store }` — not a deps array. The deps array lives on the inner `useCallback` you pass in, which is already covered by the base `exhaustive-deps` rule. Adding `useAtomCallback` to `additionalHooks` would generate false positives.

### Step 4b (mobile tabs) — Mobile tab content flags (2026-05-19)

- `src/pages/map/layouts/mobile/tab-has-content.tsx`: `mobileTabHasContentState` → `mobileTabHasContentAtomFamily`. Built with `atomFamily` from `jotai-family` (the supported successor to `jotai/utils`' deprecated `atomFamily`). String `tabId` param → default reference equality is sufficient. `MobileTabContentWatcher`: `useSetRecoilState` → `useSetAtom`.
- `src/lib/mobile-tabs/TabNavigationAction.tsx`: prop type `RecoilReadableStateFamily<boolean, string>` → `JotaiReadableStateFamily<boolean, string>` (from `@/lib/jotai/types`); prop renamed `tabHasContentState` → `tabHasContentAtomFamily`; `useRecoilValue` → `useAtomValue`.
- `src/pages/map/layouts/mobile/MobileBottomSheet.tsx`: updated import + prop name.
- Cross-cutting check (`rg "mobileTabHasContent"`): no orphaned references.
- Verified: `npm run test:type-check`, eslint on changed folders.
- Manual test (when at a browser): shrink to mobile width, switch between bottom-sheet tabs, verify tabs with no content stay disabled and the ones with content are enabled.

### Decisions taken during Step 4b (mobile tabs)

- **Atom family naming convention**: families get the `*AtomFamily` suffix (e.g. `mobileTabHasContentAtomFamily`). Rationale: a "family" is a function that produces atoms — calling the value itself an `*Atom` is misleading, and `*Atoms` (plural) is ambiguous with "array of atoms". Apply this everywhere atom families are renamed.
- **Prop name follow-through**: when a component prop holds a state family (e.g. `TabNavigationAction`'s `tabHasContentState`), rename the prop alongside the export so the call site reads consistently (`tabHasContentAtomFamily={mobileTabHasContentAtomFamily}`). Slightly more disruptive but keeps the migrated surface self-documenting.
