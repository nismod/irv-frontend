# Data Extract Downloads

This page provides access to extracts of the datasets presented in the tool. The
extracts are organised by country and data source.

Datasets can be requested individually for each country. They are then prepared
for download and available for all users through this page.

Please note that the process of preparing a dataset can take a significant
amount of time, depending on the size of the country and complexity of the data.

For programmatic interactions with this service, please also refer to the [API
documentation](https://global.infrastructureresilience.org/extract/redoc),
[Python client](https://github.com/nismod/irv-autopkg-client) and [usage
examples](https://github.com/nismod/irv-autopkg-use).
