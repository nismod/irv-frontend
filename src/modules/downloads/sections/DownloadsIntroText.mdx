# Data Extract Downloads

This page provides access to extracts of the datasets presented in the tool. The extracts are organised by country and data source.

Datasets can be requested individually for each country, after which they are prepared for download and available for everyone through this website.

Please note that the process of preparing a dataset can take a significant amount of time, depending on the size of the country and complexity of the data. The user is presented with a progress indicator during the process.
