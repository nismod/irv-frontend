          This builds on previous research and development funded by UK AID through the UK Foreign
          and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) as part of a project with the Government of
          Jamaica (GoJ) under the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment&rsquo;s (CCRI) work on
          "Systemic Resilience" in collaboration with the Green Climate Fund, and also through the
          High-Volume Transport Applied Research project.

          Similarly, earlier versions of the tool piloted in Argentina and South-East Asia were
          funded by the Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program (DRFIP) of the World Bank with
          support from the Japanâ€”World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in Developing Countries,
          which is financed by the Government of Japan and managed by the Global Facility for
          Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) through the Tokyo Disaster Risk Management Hub.
